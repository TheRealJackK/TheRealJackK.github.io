His vast armies of Orcs and other fell creatures were unleashed upon the world, but the Last Alliance of Men and Elves defeated his hordes and finally laid siege to his fortress of Barad-dûr in the land of Mordor.

Captains will take up heavy bolt rifles to lay down punishing fire and wear Gravis armour to withstand the foe's best attempts to dislodge them. Fighting in such a way, they are a symbol of the Space Marines' indomitable will to never fail.</p>

Since the loss of the Entwives, Treebeard has cared little for the goings-on of those outside Fangorn Forest, instead concerning himself with shepherding those under his care. Should a threat come to Fangorn, Treebeard will undoubtedly unleash his wrath against it.</p>

The massed, howling forces of Chaos are their sworn, hated enemies, and they will soon feel the wrath of sigmarite crossbow bolts and hissing, crackling arrows of purest lightning. The Judicators disseminate their anger with stoic mercilessness, and leave nothing in their wake but death.
